# Capstone_Project_1
This Project is done as a part of the course The Complete 2023 Web Development Boot Camp. Here we have built a resume website. Only HTML was allowed. We couldn't use CSS so some of the work might seem inefficient or outdated. But due to the restrictions it was done in such inefficient way.
